## âœ¨ Welcome

The MODC is an initiative by the students of MIET-20 to promote open source culture. The hub is all about contributing to and collaborating on projects, networking, learning together and guiding students. We conduct talks, workshops, activities, one-to-one sessions and dev-sprints to mentor students.

We encourage students to volunteer for open source projects and organisations and participate in open source initiatives such as Google Summer of Code and Outreachy to become better developers and for the betterment of open source.

# Vision:
We envision creating a dynamic and inclusive community of students, alumni, and faculty members of MIET. By leveraging the power of GitHub, we strive to promote collaboration, knowledge sharing, and innovation among our members. Our collective vision is to build a strong network that transcends the boundaries of time and creates a lasting impact.

# Goals:
1. Collaboration and Contribution: We encourage all MIET students, alumni, and faculty members to actively participate in this repository by sharing projects, code snippets, and resources related to various fields of study.

2. Learning and Skill Development: Through the repository, we aim to provide a platform for members to enhance their technical skills, learn from each other, and stay updated with the latest trends in technology.

3. Networking and Mentorship: We aspire to connect current students with experienced alumni members who can offer guidance, mentorship, and career advice. Together, we can foster a strong professional network and create opportunities for personal growth.

4. Showcasing Achievements: We want to celebrate the accomplishments of MIET students and alumni. The repository will serve as a showcase for notable projects, research papers, hackathon wins, and any other outstanding achievements.

# Join us:
Whether you're a current student, an alumnus/alumna, or a faculty member, we invite you to join our GitHub organization and be a part of our growing community. Contribute your projects, share your knowledge, collaborate with fellow members, and let's build a vibrant ecosystem together.

Let's code, collaborate, and create a brighter future for the Model Institute of Engineering and Technology!
