## âœ¨ Welcome

The MIET is an initiative by the students of MIET-20 to promote open source culture. The hub is all about contributing to and collaborating on projects, networking, learning together and guiding students. We conduct talks, workshops, activities, one-to-one sessions and dev-sprints to mentor students.

We encourage them to volunteer for open source projects and organisations and participate in open source initiatives such as Google Summer of Code and Outreachy to become better developers and for the betterment of open source.
